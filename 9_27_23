chaining for hash table:

when we have a number of keys that return the same hash value

h(k1)=1
go to the hash table, and i try to link bucket 1 to this key
h(k2)=1
h(k4)=1

attach key 1 to key 2 to key 4 under a linked list struct

h(k3)=4 
goes in at 4

worst case for chaining is n as it has to traverse all data entries O(n)'

loading factor
a=n/m measures how full the hash table is

when chaining 

the table size is equal to the number of the total linked list
a would be the average number of the linked list

performance of chaing

find(key): finds key from the list tables: O(1+a) time on average

Remark: if a is a constant or bounded by a constant O(1)

deleting takes O(2+a) on average
