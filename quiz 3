Quiz 3 [linked list - skip lists] 20min ~2questions

Linked lists

2 can exist single linked list or double linked list

Singly: one direction Head to Tail

Advangtage: Less memory [data + pointer down]
Disadvantage: Slower to find or work on {know less}

Doubly: bi direction head only

advantage: faster to find things 
disadavantage: eats up memory [data + pointer up + pointer down]

9 says linked list but includes nothing
**maybe review HW that exists

or principles of removal, insertion, sorting, appending, etc

skip lists
lec 10-11
DS is basically a "randomized" dynamic search structure. The structure is ideally based upon popularirty i believe but will be created here through random assignment.

contains dynamic set of n elements with O(logn) 

these use binary search and stacks of layers
effectively use the exclusive property of > and < to speed up process of data access

concept of search cost |L1|+|L0|/|L1| has to read L1 and then a smmall chunk of L0
2 layer = 2*(sqrt(n))

log(n) layers = log(n)*(n)^(1/log(n)) = O(logn)

to insert into a skip list:
search, find posistion, insert point, insert point from bottom layer up with chance of 0.5 probability per layer

to delete into a skip list:
find and remove [update pointers as list construct]
