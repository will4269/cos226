merging heaps -> graphs

2 heaps merging: Skew merging

Compare roots of 2 heaps that are given

Let H1 be the one with the smaller root, and H2 is the smaller heap 

H is the name of the resultant new heap

2)Let root of the H be the root of H1 (smallest root), let H's right subrtree be H1's left subtree

3)now compute H's left subtree by using H1's right subtree and H2

                                1                              13
                              /  \                          /      \
                            4      23                      17      93
                          /  \   /   \                    / \     /  \
                        63  24  44  28                   57  49 105   201
                               [H1]                               [H2]

                               create H

root of H1 is root (1)

left of H1 is right of H
                               1
                              /  \
                                  4
                                 /   \
                                63    24

compute left subtree with H2 and right side of H1

{13 is removed from H2 as it is smaller than 23, insert its left as the right, continue on with branches of tree}

G=(V,E)

V=Set of vertices

Paths and cycles

Path is set of edges to node A->D (AB,BC,CD) or (AC,CD)

cycle os loops possible (AB,BC,CA)

shortest path (SP)

is associated to the weight of path in weighted graphs

weights reolace path 0 or 1 with values such as 0-infinity to represent difficulty.

                               1
                              /  \

                /  \
              105  205

      For maximum case 
      use the largest root for H (H1), use its left subtree as H1 right subtree
